## 🔥 Latest Updates
### June 12 2025: WanGP v5.6
👋 *Finetune models*: You find the 20 models supported by WanGP not sufficient ? Too impatient to wait for the next release to get the support for a newly released model ? Your prayers have been answered: if a new model is compatible with a model architecture supported by WanGP, you can add yourself the support for this model in WanGP by just creating Finetune model definition. You can then store this model in the cloud (for instance in Huggingface) and the very light finetune definition file can be easily shared with other users. WanGP will download automatically the finetuned model for them.

To celebrate this new feature, I have provided 4 finetuned model definitions:
- *Fast Hunyuan Video* : generate model t2v in only 6 steps
- *Hunyuan Vido AccVideo* : generate model t2v in only 5 steps
- *Wan FusioniX*: it is a combo of AccVideo / CausVid ans other models and can generate high quality Wan videos in only 8 steps
- *Vace FusioniX*: the ultimate Vace model, as it is a combo of Vace / AccVideo / CausVid ans other models and can generate high quality Wan Controled videos in only 10 steps

Check the *Finetune Guide* to create finetune models definitions and share them on the WanGP discord server.

### June 11 2025: WanGP v5.5
👋 *Hunyuan Video Custom Audio*: it is similar to Hunyuan Video Avatar except there isn't any lower limit on the number of frames and you can use your reference images in a different context than the image itself\
*Hunyuan Video Custom Edit*: Hunyuan Video Controlnet, use it to do inpainting and replace a person in a video while still keeping his poses. Similar to Vace but less restricted than the Wan models in terms of content...


### June 6 2025: WanGP v5.41
👋 Bonus release: Support for **AccVideo** Lora to speed up x2 Video generations in Wan models. Check the Loras documentation to get the usage instructions of AccVideo.\
You will need to do a *pip install -r requirements.txt*

### June 6 2025: WanGP v5.4
👋 World Exclusive : **Hunyuan Video Avatar** Support ! You won't need 80 GB of VRAM nor 32 GB oF VRAM, just 10 GB of VRAM will be sufficient to generate up to 15s of high quality speech / song driven Video at a high speed with no quality degradation. Support for TeaCache included.\
Here is a link to the original repo where you will find some very interesting documentation and examples. https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanVideo-Avatar. Kudos to the Hunyuan Video Avatar team for the best model of its kind.\
Also many thanks to Reevoy24 for his repackaging / completing the documentation

### May 28 2025: WanGP v5.31
👋 Added **Phantom 14B**, a model that you can use to transfer objects / people in the video. My preference goes to Vace that remains the king of controlnets.
VACE improvements: Better sliding window transitions, image mask support in Matanyone, new Extend Video feature, and enhanced background removal options.

### May 26, 2025: WanGP v5.3
👋 Settings management revolution! Now you can:
- Select any generated video and click *Use Selected Video Settings* to instantly reuse its configuration
- Drag & drop videos to automatically extract their settings metadata
- Export/import settings as JSON files for easy sharing and backup

### May 20, 2025: WanGP v5.2
👋 **CausVid support** - Generate videos in just 4-12 steps with the new distilled Wan model! Also added experimental MoviiGen for 1080p generation (20GB+ VRAM required). Check the Loras documentation to get the usage instructions of CausVid.

### May 18, 2025: WanGP v5.1
👋 **LTX Video 13B Distilled** - Generate high-quality videos in less than one minute!

### May 17, 2025: WanGP v5.0

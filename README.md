## 🔥 Latest Updates
### July 15 2025: WanGP v7.0 is an AI Powered Photoshop
This release turns the Wan models into Image Generators. This goes way more than allowing to generate a video made of single frame :
- Multiple Images generated at the same time so that you can choose the one you like best.It is Highly VRAM optimized so that you can generate for instance 4 720p Images at the same time with less than 10 GB
- With the *image2image* the original text2video WanGP becomes an image upsampler / restorer
- *Vace image2image* comes out of the box with image outpainting, person / object replacement, ...
- You can use in one click a newly Image generated as Start Image or Reference Image for a Video generation

And to complete the full suite of AI Image Generators, Ladies and Gentlemen please welcome for the first time in WanGP : **Flux Kontext**.\
As a reminder Flux Kontext is an image editor : give it an image and a prompt and it will do the change for you.\
This highly optimized version of Flux Kontext will make you feel that you have been cheated all this time as WanGP Flux Kontext requires only 8 GB of VRAM to generate 4 images at the same time with no need for quantization.

WanGP v7 comes with *Image2image* vanilla and *Vace FusinoniX*. However you can build your own finetune where you will combine a text2video or Vace model with any combination of Loras.

Also in the news:
- You can now enter the *Bbox* for each speaker in *Multitalk* to precisely locate who is speaking. And to save some headaches the *Image Mask generator* will give you the *Bbox* coordinates of an area you have selected.
- *Film Grain* post processing to add a vintage look at your video
- *First Last Frame to Video* model should work much better now as I have discovered rencently its implementation was not complete
- More power for the finetuners, you can now embed Loras directly in the finetune definition. You can also override the default models (titles, visibility, ...) with your own finetunes. Check the doc that has been updated.


### July 10 2025: WanGP v6.7, is NAG a game changer ? you tell me
Maybe you knew that already but most *Loras accelerators* we use today (Causvid, FusioniX) don't use *Guidance* at all (that it is *CFG* is set to 1). This helps to get much faster generations but the downside is that *Negative Prompts* are completely ignored (including the default ones set by the models). **NAG** (https://github.com/ChenDarYen/Normalized-Attention-Guidance) aims to solve that by injecting the *Negative Prompt* during the *attention* processing phase.

So WanGP 6.7 gives you NAG, but not any NAG, a *Low VRAM* implementation, the default one ends being VRAM greedy. You will find NAG in the *General* advanced tab for most Wan models. 

Use NAG especially when Guidance is set to 1. To turn it on set the **NAG scale** to something around 10. There are other NAG parameters **NAG tau** and **NAG alpha** which I recommend to change only if you don't get good results by just playing with the NAG scale. Don't hesitate to share on this discord server the best combinations for these 3 parameters.

The authors of NAG claim that NAG can also be used when using a Guidance (CFG > 1) and to improve the prompt adherence.

### July 8 2025: WanGP v6.6, WanGP offers you **Vace Multitalk Dual Voices Fusionix Infinite** :
**Vace** our beloved super Control Net has been combined with **Multitalk** the new king in town that can animate up to two people speaking (**Dual Voices**). It is accelerated by the **Fusionix** model and thanks to *Sliding Windows* support and *Adaptive Projected Guidance* (much slower but should reduce the reddish effect with long videos) your two people will be able to talk for very a long time (which is an **Infinite** amount of time in the field of video generation).

Of course you will get as well *Multitalk* vanilla and also *Multitalk 720p* as a bonus.

And since I am mister nice guy I have enclosed as an exclusivity an *Audio Separator* that will save you time to isolate each voice when using Multitalk with two people.

As I feel like resting a bit I haven't produced yet a nice sample Video to illustrate all these new capabilities. But here is the thing, I ams sure you will publish in the *Share Your Best Video* channel your *Master Pieces*. The best ones will be added to the *Announcements Channel* and will bring eternal fame to its authors.

But wait, there is more:
- Sliding Windows support has been added anywhere with Wan models, so imagine with text2video recently upgraded in 6.5 into a video2video, you can now upsample very long videos regardless of your VRAM. The good old image2video model can now reuse the last image to produce new videos (as requested by many of you)
- I have added also the capability to transfer the audio of the original control video (Misc. advanced tab) and an option to preserve the fps into the generated video, so from now on you will be to upsample / restore your old families video and keep the audio at their original pace. Be aware that the duration will be limited to 1000 frames as I still need to add streaming support for unlimited video sizes.

Also, of interest too:
- Extract video info from Videos that have not been generated by WanGP, even better you can also apply post processing (Upsampling / MMAudio) on non WanGP videos
- Force the generated video fps to your liking, works wery well with Vace when using a Control Video
- Ability to chain URLs of Finetune models (for instance put the URLs of a model in your main finetune and reference this finetune in other finetune models to save time)

### July 2 2025: WanGP v6.5.1, WanGP takes care of you: lots of quality of life features:
- View directly inside WanGP the properties (seed, resolutions, length, most settings...) of the past generations
- In one click use the newly generated video as a Control Video or Source Video to be continued 
- Manage multiple settings for the same model and switch between them using a dropdown box 
- WanGP will keep the last generated videos in the Gallery and will remember the last model you used if you restart the app but kept the Web page open
- Custom resolutions : add a file in the WanGP folder with the list of resolutions you want to see in WanGP (look at the instruction readme in this folder)

Taking care of your life is not enough, you want new stuff to play with ?
- MMAudio directly inside WanGP : add an audio soundtrack that matches the content of your video. By the way it is a low VRAM MMAudio and 6 GB of VRAM should be sufficient. You will need to go in the *Extensions* tab of the WanGP *Configuration* to enable MMAudio
- Forgot to upsample your video during the generation ? want to try another MMAudio variation ? Fear not you can also apply upsampling or add an MMAudio track once the video generation is done. Even better you can ask WangGP for multiple variations of MMAudio to pick the one you like best
- MagCache support: a new step skipping approach, supposed to be better than TeaCache. Makes a difference if you usually generate with a high number of steps
- SageAttention2++ support : not just the compatibility but also a slightly reduced VRAM usage
- Video2Video in Wan Text2Video : this is the paradox, a text2video can become a video2video if you start the denoising process later on an existing video
- FusioniX upsampler: this is an illustration of Video2Video in Text2Video. Use the FusioniX text2video model with an output resolution of 1080p and a denoising strength of 0.25 and you will get one of the best upsamplers (in only 2/3 steps, you will need lots of VRAM though). Increase the denoising strength and you will get one of the best Video Restorer
- Choice of Wan Samplers / Schedulers
- More Lora formats support

**If you had upgraded to v6.5 please upgrade again to 6.5.1 as this will fix a bug that ignored Loras beyond the first one**

### June 23 2025: WanGP v6.3, Vace Unleashed. Thought we couldnt squeeze Vace even more ?
- Multithreaded preprocessing when possible for faster generations
- Multithreaded frames Lanczos Upsampling as a bonus
- A new Vace preprocessor : *Flow* to extract fluid motion
- Multi Vace Controlnets: you can now transfer several properties at the same time. This opens new possibilities to explore, for instance if you transfer *Human Movement* and *Shapes* at the same time for some reasons the lighting of your character will take into account much more the environment of your character.
- Injected Frames Outpainting, in case you missed it in WanGP 6.21

Don't know how to use all of the Vace features ? Check the Vace Guide embedded in WanGP as it has also been updated.


### June 19 2025: WanGP v6.2, Vace even more Powercharged
👋 Have I told you that I am a big fan of Vace ? Here are more goodies to unleash its power: 
- If you ever wanted to watch Star Wars in 4:3, just use the new *Outpainting* feature and it will add the missing bits of image at the top and the bottom of the screen. The best thing is *Outpainting* can be combined with all the other Vace modifications, for instance you can change the main character of your favorite movie at the same time  
- More processing can combined at the same time  (for instance the depth process can be applied outside the mask)
- Upgraded the depth extractor to Depth Anything 2 which is much more detailed

As a bonus, I have added two finetunes based on the Safe-Forcing technology (which requires only 4 steps to generate a video): Wan 2.1 text2video Self-Forcing and Vace Self-Forcing. I know there is Lora around but the quality of the Lora is worse (at least with Vace) compared to the full model. Don't hesitate to share your opinion about this on the discord server. 
### June 17 2025: WanGP v6.1, Vace Powercharged
👋 Lots of improvements for Vace the Mother of all Models:
- masks can now be combined with on the fly processing of a control video, for instance you can extract the motion of a specific person defined by a mask
- on the fly modification of masks : reversed masks (with the same mask you can modify the background instead of the people covered by the masks), enlarged masks (you can cover more area if for instance the person you are trying to inject is larger than the one in the mask), ...
- view these modified masks directly inside WanGP during the video generation to check they are really as expected
- multiple frames injections: multiples frames can be injected at any location of the video
- expand past videos in on click: just select one generated video to expand it

Of course all these new stuff work on all Vace finetunes (including Vace Fusionix).

Thanks also to Reevoy24 for adding a Notfication sound at the end of a generation and for fixing the background color of the current generation summary.

### June 12 2025: WanGP v6.0
👋 *Finetune models*: You find the 20 models supported by WanGP not sufficient ? Too impatient to wait for the next release to get the support for a newly released model ? Your prayers have been answered: if a new model is compatible with a model architecture supported by WanGP, you can add by yourself the support for this model in WanGP by just creating a finetune model definition. You can then store this model in the cloud (for instance in Huggingface) and the very light finetune definition file can be easily shared with other users. WanGP will download automatically the finetuned model for them.

To celebrate the new finetunes support, here are a few finetune gifts (directly accessible from the model selection menu):
- *Fast Hunyuan Video* : generate model t2v in only 6 steps
- *Hunyuan Vido AccVideo* : generate model t2v in only 5 steps
- *Wan FusioniX*: it is a combo of AccVideo / CausVid ans other models and can generate high quality Wan videos in only 8 steps

One more thing...

The new finetune system can be used to combine complementaty models : what happens when you combine  Fusionix Text2Video and Vace Control Net ?

You get **Vace FusioniX**: the Ultimate Vace Model, Fast (10 steps, no need for guidance) and with a much better quality Video than the original slower model (despite being the best Control Net out there). Here goes one more finetune...

Check the *Finetune Guide* to create finetune models definitions and share them on the WanGP discord server.

### June 11 2025: WanGP v5.5
👋 *Hunyuan Video Custom Audio*: it is similar to Hunyuan Video Avatar except there isn't any lower limit on the number of frames and you can use your reference images in a different context than the image itself\
*Hunyuan Video Custom Edit*: Hunyuan Video Controlnet, use it to do inpainting and replace a person in a video while still keeping his poses. Similar to Vace but less restricted than the Wan models in terms of content...


### June 6 2025: WanGP v5.41
👋 Bonus release: Support for **AccVideo** Lora to speed up x2 Video generations in Wan models. Check the Loras documentation to get the usage instructions of AccVideo.\
You will need to do a *pip install -r requirements.txt*

### June 6 2025: WanGP v5.4
👋 World Exclusive : **Hunyuan Video Avatar** Support ! You won't need 80 GB of VRAM nor 32 GB oF VRAM, just 10 GB of VRAM will be sufficient to generate up to 15s of high quality speech / song driven Video at a high speed with no quality degradation. Support for TeaCache included.\
Here is a link to the original repo where you will find some very interesting documentation and examples. https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanVideo-Avatar. Kudos to the Hunyuan Video Avatar team for the best model of its kind.\
Also many thanks to Reevoy24 for his repackaging / completing the documentation

### May 28 2025: WanGP v5.31
👋 Added **Phantom 14B**, a model that you can use to transfer objects / people in the video. My preference goes to Vace that remains the king of controlnets.
VACE improvements: Better sliding window transitions, image mask support in Matanyone, new Extend Video feature, and enhanced background removal options.

### May 26, 2025: WanGP v5.3
👋 Settings management revolution! Now you can:
- Select any generated video and click *Use Selected Video Settings* to instantly reuse its configuration
- Drag & drop videos to automatically extract their settings metadata
- Export/import settings as JSON files for easy sharing and backup

### May 20, 2025: WanGP v5.2
👋 **CausVid support** - Generate videos in just 4-12 steps with the new distilled Wan model! Also added experimental MoviiGen for 1080p generation (20GB+ VRAM required). Check the Loras documentation to get the usage instructions of CausVid.

### May 18, 2025: WanGP v5.1
👋 **LTX Video 13B Distilled** - Generate high-quality videos in less than one minute!

### May 17, 2025: WanGP v5.0
👋 **One App to Rule Them All!** Added Hunyuan Video and LTX Video support, plus Vace 14B and integrated prompt enhancer.
